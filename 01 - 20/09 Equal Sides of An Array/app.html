    <h1>Equal Sides Of An Array</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
            Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.</li>
        <li>Let's look at another one.
            You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
            Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.</li>
        <li>You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
            At index 0 the left side is {}
            The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
            They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
            Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.</p>
    <h2>Input:</h2>
    <p>The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.</p>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <p>If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.</p>
